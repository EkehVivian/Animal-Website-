  <h1>Detailed Profile Of Each Animals</h1>
  <p>An <strong>animal shelter</strong> or pound is a place where stray, lost, abandoned or surrendered animals – mostly
    dogs and cats – are housed. The word "pound" has its origins in the animal pounds of agricultural communities, where
    stray livestock would be penned or impounded until they were claimed by their owners.

    While no-kill shelters exist, it is sometimes policy to euthanize animals that are not claimed quickly enough by a
    previous or new owner. In Europe, of the 30 countries included in a survey, all but five (Austria,[1] Czech
    Republic,[2] Germany, Greece and Italy) permitted euthanizing non-adopted animals.</p>
  <h3 class="of">Importance of Animal Shelter</h3>
  <p>Animal shelters play a vital role in our communities as they continuously work to reunite pets with their owners,
    shelter those in need and find new homes for animals that are lost, without a permanent home or for those animals
    that, for our own security, shouldn't be roaming our streets.</p>

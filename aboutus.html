 <p> Here at <strong>Vee Animal Shelter (VAS)</strong> we do our utmost to match our animals with the most suited family for them, and vice versa. All of our animals undergo an assessment when they first arrive at the Shelter to determine what the most suitable home for them will be.

All of our animals are seen by our vet team on arrival at the Shelter for an initial health check and will be seen again for a rehoming health check before they leave for their new home. All dogs, cats and rabbits are micro-chipped, neutered, vaccinated and will receive 4 weeks Free Charity PetPlan insurance upon adoption. Dogs and Cats will also be fully up to date with their flea and worm treatments. Please note that unless agreed otherwise, Cheltenham Animal Shelter are not responsible for any medical costs after the date of adoption.

If you hope to meet and potentially reserve an animal, then we would recommend that all of your family come to the first meeting. Before reserving an animal you will be required to complete an application form and have a 1-1 meeting with a member of our rehoming team.

All of our animals require a non-refundable deposit in order to reserve them. After your first visit no further visits can take place until a deposit has been paid.</p>

<h3>Please note that Vee Animal Shelter reserve the right to cancel the adoption of any animal, at our discretion, if we do not feel that you and the animal are suitable for each other.</h3>
